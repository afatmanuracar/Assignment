Equation:  
f(a,b,c)=âˆ‘(0,1,5,6,7)

## Tasks
1- Simplify the logical expression of the equation by using K-map. (on paper or on simulation, its up to you!)  
2- Implement simplified logical expression using logic gates. (You can use ICs too if you want.)  
3- Run the simulator and simulate every case (8) of truth table in order. (Gif or video)  
4- Save and Upload your circuit Digital design file to the repo like **Assignment4.dig**.
